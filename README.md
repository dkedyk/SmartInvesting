This financial planning spreadsheet (in OpenOffice format) is for the readers of the book (see https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CP9GPBW1), and for personal use only. For commercial use please reach out (my email is in the book's preface and back cover).

I ask that you please post an honest review of the book on Amazon.com in return. The feedback I got so far has been limited, and I need it to improve the book further. This is hobby project that is worked on weekends/evenings, so any assistance is greatly appreciated.

Please see the README tab of the spreadsheet for more information. This spreadsheet currently contains data from an imaginary sample family. Enter your data in the FamilyData tab to use.

Github seems to have a bug in downloading the spreadsheet--"view raw" may work, otherwise the best way to get it is to download the entire repository.
